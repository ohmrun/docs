There are five value abstractions in the Stx library

1) [Value Wrappers](value_wrappers.md)
    
    Easily structure values, carry error information without unpredicatable throws, and use a consistent API for collections and monads.

2) [Futures/Promises](futures_promises.md)

    Take the same API over gaps caused by polling and event waiting.

3) [Arrowlets](arrowlets.md)

    Open ended compositional programming: chunk operations in a testable way, and forward work to a scheduler no matter the platform.

4) [Coroutines](coroutines.md)

    Compose operations over streams of values, and deliver to the scheduler, ingestion and production of values being an explicit part of the API.

5) [Proxies](proxies.md)

    Bind upstream and downstream coroutines to manage sophisticated input/output schema
