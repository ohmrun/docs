These documents present general information about the stx libraries and I'll update as I can.

The libraries cover iteration, streams, coroutines, proxies (pairwise bounded coroutines) and ties it together with an effect system similar to `ZIO` called `Fletcher`.

This system as it stands is implementable in anything that has generics (and optionally tagged enumerations).
